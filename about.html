            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hi, I'm Marco, a student majoring in Computer Science at University of Cabuyao. I'm passionate about exploring how websites can enhance user experiences and leveraging my skills to create impactful digital solutions. Currently, I'm engaged in projects focusing on front-end development, which I find incredibly rewarding. In my leisure time, I enjoy designing digital art and volunteering with tech outreach programs in my community. I'm excited about pursuing a career where I can innovate and contribute to the world of web development.</p>
            <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring the outdoors, playing online games, and learning about new technology trends. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate on a project or just want to say hello!</p>
